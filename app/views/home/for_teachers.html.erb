        <li><strong>Topic</strong> (Climate change, Earth and atmosphere, Energy, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>
      </ul>



      <p><strong>The majority of the activities and lesson plans are within the context of your school and make use of the extensive charting and analysis of your school’s smart meter data provided on the website.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>The starting point for teachers using Energy Sparks is your 'Teacher's Dashboard' which is specific to your school.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>This provides a focal point for your energy related teaching, including:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Charts:</strong> showing your school’s recent gas and electricity use.</li>
        <li><strong>Alerts:</strong>highlighting recent significant changes in your energy use, and hints an tips on how to reduce your energy consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Suggested lessons and activities:</strong> to make choosing a lesson plan or eco-team project easy the dashboard provides a list of suggested activities, these are contextual to the time of year or a recent change that Energy Sparks has noticed in your energy usage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pupil's dashboard</h2>
      <p>Energy Sparks has a separate dashboard designed for school pupils, which presents energy information in a more pupil friendly manner.</p>

      <p>The content is focussed on encouraging pupils to actively engage in promoting energy saving in the school and take part in energy saving activities. The ultimate aim of the dashboard is to provide them with a greater understanding of energy and climate change.</p>

      <p>'Equivalences' are introduced to help pupils understand the energy, monetary or climate impact of energy use within your school e.g. "Your school has used 100,000 kWh of electricity in the last year. This is the energy generated by 410 solar panels in a year".</p>

      <p>Support for pupils is provided in designing and carrying out experiments to monitor energy related data and behaviour patterns at school.</p>
