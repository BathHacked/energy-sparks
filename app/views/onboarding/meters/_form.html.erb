    <h1>New meter</h1>
    <p>The Meter Point Number is also known as the MPAN (for electricity meters) and the MPRN (for gas meters).</p>
    <p>Your MPAN should be printed on your electricity bill. It is a 13 digit number, and can be referred to as a ‘Supply Number’. An example number is: 20 0001 5001 165. Do not confuse your MPAN with your electricity supplier account number or the meter serial number printed on your electricity meter.</p>

    <p>Your MPRN should be printed on your gas bill. The format of a MPRN is standard. It is between 6-10 numerical digits long. Do not confuse your MPRN with your gas supplier account number or the meter serial number printed on your gas meter.</p>
