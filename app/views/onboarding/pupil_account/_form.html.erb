  Pupil accounts allow your school's pupils to log into Energy Sparks using only a password, no email address is required.
  These accounts can be created to be used in classrooms or with eco-teams, one account per classroom or team and the passwords can then be shared with the pupils.

  You can create more pupil accounts once your school is activated.
